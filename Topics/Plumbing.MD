### Installation
* [How to install a faucet hole cover](http://homeguides.sfgate.com/install-cover-extra-hole-kitchen-sink-45477.html)


* [How to wrap pipe with teflon tape](http://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/2821/how-do-i-wrap-pipe-threads-with-teflon-tape) = clockwise (like tightening a nut)
```
# Wrap teflon tape clock-wise (with the grain).
# Two or three wrappings.
```

* [When to use pipe dope vs teflon tape](http://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/21117/when-should-pipe-dope-vs-thread-tape-be-used) | [Video](http://www.thisoldhouse.com/toh/video/0,,20800953,00.html)

### Winterization
* [How to prevent frozen pipes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVItL66doqw)
```
Prevention:
  1. Seal exterior/interior penetrations; foam.
  2. Wrap pipes with foam.
  
Thawing:
  1. Keep tap open and apply heat to frozen area (open doors,
     blow-dryer, but NEVER an open flame).
  2. Pipe thawing machine.
```


* [Sprinkler system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WW4VYWamwwo)
```
1. Shut water off the water from the main water supply ot the sprinkler system.
2. Open testcock #1 (outflow; lowest of the two); see: http://media.wattswater.com/IOM-F-765.pdf.
3. Drain the water near the main water supply (allow outside air pressure to drain the line or use 60 psi air pressur).
  3a. May need to remove drain nipple.
4. Drain remaining water from valve box (underground).

NEVER just close both outside valves. This will remove the thermal connection
to the main water supply (coming from the home).

ALWAYS wrap the backflow preventer with a towel or blanket.

You may need to blow out the water if it does not drain properly; see:
http://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/51042/why-is-the-pressure-vacuum-breaker-leaking-while-trying-to-blow-out-my-sprinkler
```

### Not Fitting
* Cannot connect something to something else
```
# Disimilar thread types/connections (i.e. black iron to flare).
# Must acquire a coupling.
