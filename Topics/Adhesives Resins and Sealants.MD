### Latex vs. Silicone Caulk

Category | Latex (Acrylic/Painter's) Cualk | Silicone Caulk
---------|---------------------------------|---------------
Purposes | Better suited for gaps that stay constant | Works well in gaps that expand and contract
Application | Easier to apply than silicone | Needs meticulous surface preparation
Surface | Can be applied on porous and nonporous surfaces | Works best on nonporous surfaces
Oder | Less odor | More odor
Cleaning | Cleans up easily with soap and water | Requires mineral spirits for cleaning
Painting | Can be painted | Some can be painted (check specific product)
Removal | Easily removed | Difficult to remove
Strength | Weakens and losses flexibility in direct sunlight and extreme temperature | Is more flexible and durable than latex; holds up well in direct sunlight and temperature extremes
Durability | Doesn't last as long as silicone (under most circumstances) | Lasts longer than latex caulk (under most circumstances)

### Speciality Caulks

Caulk Type | Projects | Key Features
-----------|----------|-------------
Adhesive | Attach two pieces together; fill gaps | Prevents cracking as surfaces expand and contract
Blacktop Asphalt | Fills cracks in parking lots, driveways, and other asphalt surfaces | Forms a strong waterproof seal; resists stains from gas, oil, and deicing salts
Concrete | Fills gaps in driveways and sidewalks | Can be exposed to water shortly after application; withstands extreme temperatures
Exterior | Outdoor trim work; new window installation | UV resistant
Fire Retardant | Sealing separations around wires, pipes, HVAC ducts, and vents; chimney/fireplace or other framing gaps | Made of special material rated for its ability to block fire; noncombustible; withstands high temperature
Gutter and Flashing | Use around roof vents, gutters, flashing, drainspouts, and other metal joints | Withstands extreme temperatures; durable and flexible
Kitchen and Bath | Tile/countertop installation; tile/shower/tub maintenance; sink/faucet installation | Mildew resistant; can be exposed to water shortly after application
Mortar | Seals leaks and cracks on stucco, mortar, stone, concrete, and brick | Withstands high temperatures; blends in with textured surfaces
Moulding and Trim | Fills gaps between walls and boards; crown moulding installation | Quick dry time; paintable
Roof | Stops minor roofs leaks | Flexible, waterproof, and mildew resistant
Sanded | Fills gaps on large joints (1/8 inch or bigger); abut and match pre-existing tile/sanded grout | Appears rough and grainy; adheres well in wet areas
Window and Door Interior | Window/door maintenance | Won't shrink or crack
Unsanded | Fills very tight joints; to join tile and counters | Smooth finish
