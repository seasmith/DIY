### Wood Coatings
* [Shellac vs Polyurethane vs Varnish vs Lacquer and Others](http://www.diynetwork.com/how-to/skills-and-know-how/painting/whats-the-difference-between-polyurethane-varnish-shellac-and-lacquer)

Finisher | What it is | How it looks | How it stands up
---------|------------|--------------|-----------------
Shellac | Lac bug secretion and denatured alcohol |  Adds warm amber | Safe when hardened/dried; affected by heat
Polyurethane (water-based) | Liquid plastic | Goes on clear  | Low odor; low toxicity; fast drying; affected by heat/chemicals
Polyurethane (fortified water-based) | Liquid plastic | Goes on clear (wood; latex/acrylic paint)  | Stands up better to heat; can go over oil-based finishes
Polyurethane (oil-based) | Liquid plastic | Slight amber (wood); yellow hue (latex/acrylic paint) | Stands up to heat; high odor; long drying
Varnish | [Resin (drying oil and solvent)][varnish.1] | Protective top coat | Durable; heat-resistant; UV protection; water-resistant
[Lacquer][lacquer.1] | Lacquer gum or dissolved nitrocellulose | Gloss/matte/resin (paint) | Durable; paint protective; damage-resistant; discolors
[Linseed Oil][linseed.1] | Dried flax seeds | Adds amber/darken | Boiled linseed oil commonly used on wooden tool handles
