* [Which drill bit to use?](http://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/2254/which-type-of-drill-bit-for-which-jobs?lq=1)

Type | When to use | Picture
-----|-------------|--------
Forstner | Shallow hole; flat bottom; clean sides; drill press; mortises; half-blind dovetails; guided | ![Forstner](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Qc8jp.jpg)
Auger | Deep hole; straight; studs; guided; LOW RPM (dangerous at high RPM) | ![Auger](http://i.stack.imgur.com/HLbo8s.jpg)
Spade | Quick; coarse cuts; slip into adjacent holes; guided | ![Spade](http://i.stack.imgur.com/lU9Yos.jpg)
Brad Point | Small-sized holes; minimal tearout; guided | ![Brad Point](http://i.stack.imgur.com/sf8ECs.jpg)
* [Why use auger bits (over forstner and spade)?](http://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/2040/do-auger-bits-have-advantages) | Deep holes; straight holes; carries out debris better than forstener; rigid; cheaper than forstner bits; best when drilling by hand

### Sanding

Type | Description
-----|------------
Block | <ul><li>Good for dry sanding and sanding with high grit count (180+).</li></ul>
Sponge | <ul><li>Good for wet sanding (i.e. after applying varnish). Sponge does not slip around unlike a block. [[1]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zcy2tPa3hw8&feature=youtu.be&start=249)</li></ul>
Orbital Sander | <ul><li>Leaves unnoticeable sanding marks.</li><li>Ultra-smooth sanding.</li><li>Rounding over sharp edges.</li><li>Sand off hardened wood putty.</li><li>Knocking down dried coats of paint or varnish.</li></ul>
Random Orbit Sander | <ul><li>Similar to the orbital sander but can be used for some stock removal (similar to belt sanders).</li><li>Has a circular sander surface, compared to the orbital's square surface.</li><li>Velcro (hook-and-loop) and PSA (pressure sensitive adhesive) discs.</li></ul>
Belt Sander | <ul><li>For smoothing large flat surfaces.</li><li>Smoothing rough or coarse surfaces.</li></ul>

Bevel | Not 90 to face
Double Bevel | Two cuts not 90 to face
Compound | Miter + bevel

* [Shellac vs Polyurethane vs Varnish vs Lacquer and Others](http://www.diynetwork.com/how-to/skills-and-know-how/painting/whats-the-difference-between-polyurethane-varnish-shellac-and-lacquer)

### Coating Tips

Tip | Description
----|------------
Sanding | Use 120 and 220 to create a smooth surface for conditioners, stainers, and protectors
Conditioning | Pre-stain conditioner to help apply stainers
Staining | Use brush, rag, or pneumatic gun
Cleaning | Wipe of excess stain which is not absorbed. You want stain to dry in the wood NOT on top of the wood. Wipe in direction of grain
Drying | 8 hours. 12+ hours for high humidity or cold weather
Protection | Polyurethane (clear). Stir can; DO NOT shake (you do not want bubbles)
Like With Like | Use all water-based or all oil-based products - DO NOT mix

### Coating Types

Finisher | What it is | How it looks | How it stands up
---------|------------|--------------|-----------------
Shellac | Lac bug secretion and denatured alcohol |  Adds warm amber | Safe when hardened/dried; affected by heat
Polyurethane (water-based) | Liquid plastic | Goes on clear  | Low odor; low toxicity; fast drying; affected by heat/chemicals
Polyurethane (fortified water-based) | Liquid plastic | Goes on clear (wood; latex/acrylic paint)  | Stands up better to heat; can go over oil-based finishes
Polyurethane (oil-based) | Liquid plastic | Slight amber (wood); yellow hue (latex/acrylic paint) | Stands up to heat; high odor; long drying
Varnish | [Resin (drying oil and solvent)][varnish.1] | Protective top coat | Durable; heat-resistant; UV protection; water-resistant
[Lacquer][lacquer.1] | Lacquer gum or dissolved nitrocellulose | Gloss/matte/resin (paint) | Durable; paint protective; damage-resistant; discolors
[Linseed Oil][linseed.1] | Dried flax seeds | Adds amber/darken | Boiled linseed oil commonly used on wooden tool handles

## Wood Types

### Hardwood & Softwood

* The terms "hardwood" and "softwood" have no relevance to the actual hardness of the wood produced [1](http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/original-size/images/2016/07/blogs/graphic-detail/20160730_woc911_4.png).

Category | Description
---------|------------
Hardwood | Typically come from a broadleaf, deciduous tree (a tree that loses its leaves annually) [1](http://web.utk.edu/~mtaylo29/pages/Hardwoods%20and%20softwood.html)
Softwood | Come from conifers (usually remain evergreen) [1](http://www.nzwood.co.nz/faqs/what-is-the-difference-between-hardwood-and-softwood/)
